# Billing

Depending on how you use the Number Programmability service, you might receive bills from both Vonage and Nexmo.

* All charges for voice usage in the Number Programmability service applications you create are included in your Vonage Business Cloud bill.

* If your applications use other Nexmo capabilities (such as Number Insight, Messaging or Speech-to-text) then you will receive a separate bill from Nexmo for that usage. 

> **Note** If you receive bills from both Vonage and Nexmo, the invoice schedule might not be the same.

If you have a billing query, contact:

* Vonage: **who?**
* Nexmo: **who?**
